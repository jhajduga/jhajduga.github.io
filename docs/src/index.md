# G4RT Documentation

Welcome to the documentation hub for **G4RT** – the Geant4-based Radiotherapy Toolkit developed by the Dose3D team.

This book serves as a structured and version-controlled space to document:

* Installation and setup guides
* Job configuration files in TOML format
* Examples from testbeams and modules
* Development internals, logging infrastructure, and CI setups
* WSL and CVMFS environments

Use the sidebar to navigate specific topics. This documentation is work-in-progress and may evolve alongside the repository.
